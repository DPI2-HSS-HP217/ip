# NEPHILIM

Nephilim, in theory, is just a simple Java-based task manager. However, like its mythological namesake, Nephilim is more like a mistake made by someone who played around with things **they shouldn't have**.

## Getting started

You can use this affront to software development by performing the following ritual steps.
1. Have Java 17 installed on your machine.
2. Download the nephilim.jar file from [our repository](https://github.com/DPI2-HSS-HP217/ip) if it hasn't escaped containment.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your task manager.
4. Activate it using the java -jar nephilim.jar command in your terminal.
5. Type commands in the command box and press either Enter or the "Relay" button to execute it.
6. Refer to the commands list below for details of each command.

## Commands

> ### Notes about the command format:
> - All words in square brackets are parameters to be supplied by the user.
    >
    >  e.g in todo [task name], [task name] is a parameter that can be used as todo Get apple from store
> - All fields and flags are **strictly** compulsory.
> - The [date] parameter must be entered in the YYYY-MM-DD TTTT format, where TTTT is in 24 hour time.
    >
    >  e.g 2025-09-12 1500 to represent 12 Sep 2025, 3 pm.
> - The [index] parameter indicates a task's position in the list and starts from 1. This index is relative to the full list, ergo the list generated by `list`
    >
    >  e.g To delete the first task in the list, enter `delete 1`
